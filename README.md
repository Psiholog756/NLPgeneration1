This is a program for Long-text generation. Here I will upload my new codes and continously refine the existing codes already here.

The 'textbook picking' file can be launched to extract the textbooks' content and the obtained content of each textbook will be put in a json document with the title of each textbook.
And the 'medium stories' content extracting' is used to obtain the texts of the medium stories which are recorded in the csv document 'Medium_Clean'.
